Basic rules:
Statically typed language
    Must declare variables explicitly or inferred
    var myVariable string (explicitly)
    var myVariable = "Hello" (inferred)

Strongly typed language
    cannot combine two types of variables 
    a =1
    b ="two"
    c = a+b, unlike javascript

fast compiled language, translates human code to machine code binary (fast execution)

Build in concurrency done with goroutines

Simplicity syntax

Garbage collection, cleans up unused memory
